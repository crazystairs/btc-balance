// Please note:
// This script uses blockchain.info's API function /q/addressbalance and is intended for use with cold storage addresses.
// Transaction will be shown as soon as they hit the network, even without any confirmation.
// Funds showing up in balance.html will not be instantly available in the wallets containing the corresponding private keys.
// Regarding unconfirmed transactions as completed payments makes you subject to double spending attacks.
// For more details see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending
// WARNING:
// /q/addressbalance is only a reliable source for actually available funds when used on standalone (cold storage) addresses.
// The displayed value is calculated by simply adding up all incoming and outgoing transactions for the given address.
// If this address has been imported into a wallet along other funded addresses, your Bitcoin client might only partially use
// Bitcoins from this address even though the amount to spend exactly matches the sum of its incoming transactions.
// This happens to minimze transaction complexity and avoid fees if possible.
// Imagine having the private keys to two addresses in your wallet which received the following transactions:
// Address1: 5 * 0.1BTC -> 0.5BTC showing in /q/addressbalance
// Address2: 1 * 0.3BTC -> 0.3BTC showing in /q/addressbalance
// You just imported Address1 in order to "empty" it so you send 0.5BTC to some other address.
// The Bitcoin client will now examine its options and go with the following output:
// 0.3BTC from Address2 + 2*0.1BTC from Address1
// http:/blockchain.info/q/addressbalance/Address1 will now show "30000000" Satoshi = 0.3BTC
//
// So in order to find out how many Bitcoins a wallet contains is only possible if all addresses it manages are known.
// This script could be extended to also display the sum over all given addresses.
// Feel free to send me a feature or pull request.
// 
// You might want to remove this text before repeatedly using the file. This will save you 2083 Bytes per call. (http://xkcd.com/688/)
